## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.

- **Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:**

Both members of the group started in the category R1: Models level 3, as we already had knowledge of both Grasshopper and Dynamo. After this course, we moved up to R2: Analyst Level 3, as we now have the ability to create a simple script that can be used in connection with the use case "build". In the process, we used Python, BlenderBIM, and IFCopenshell. It is important to note that none of the group members had worked with Python before this course, making it a challenging but rewarding process. We have also gained a good understanding of IFCopenshell and how to extract relevant information from a model and how the IFC library is structured. This provides a good foundation for extracting specific information from a model.

- **What else do you still need to learn:**

While we have gained a basic understanding of Python by creating the script in this course, we still lack a lot of experience with Python to execute a script for a use case more easily. It will still be a significant task for us to create a well-developed and executable script for BlenderBIM.

- **How you might use OpenBIM in the future:**

In the future, we will use OpenBIM to extract data from building models, which was previously difficult for us to access. Hopefully, gaining more knowledge in Python will also help us perform more extensive calculations more easily. It would be great to implement it in our daily work for future employers.

## Your process of developing the tutorial

- **Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for the thesis?**

Yes, there is significant potential in our future work in building design, where we can use this process and mindset we have gone through in this course.

- **Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?**

No, we think it was fine to have some choices to ensure we worked on something that interested us. We chose "build" because it is one of the categories we have the most knowledge about. It also provides a better insight into what the product could actually achieve. It also made it easier to create a product since we quickly figured out what our application should be able to do.

- **Was the number of tools for the course okay - should we have more or less? - if so, which ones would you leave out?**

Since it was not a prerequisite for the course to have worked with Python before, we believe that a brief introduction to the basics of Python at the beginning of the course would have been ideal. We faced many challenges initially in getting something to work in Python.

## Your received feedback on the tutorial

- **Was the project clearly scoped?**

This feedback is from group 2:
Yes, it was. The goal was to get a price estimate, using the volume of individual elements + an external data source.

- **Was the use case well-modelled?**

Yes, it was eloquently structured and professionally presented, targeting R1: OpenBIM Modellers L2 and/or L3. The sole purpose of the project was distinct and successfully accomplished later.

- **Did the tool address the use case they identified?**

The tool addressed the identified use case. Using the Structural model of Skylab and the Molio data (via an adjacent file with information) Group 10 has managed to assign a material to the different elements via a description, and based on that and the volume, have a price result. This is a method our group didn't think of when initially starting with the same project. The tool worked very well when tested in our group, producing exactly what was expected.

- **Further advice**

We suggest more collaboration between Python scripting and BlenderBIM for the purposes of further development of their successful idea and implementation. Thank you.

## Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

- **Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?**

Yes, we can clearly see the potential in using OpenBIM in our tasks. It can help us create some universal tools that will expedite many processes in construction by implementing these tools.

- **Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?**

It depends on where we get jobs and which software is available. It is definitely something we would like to take advantage of.

## Wrap up

- **Conclude the journey through A1-A5:**

We have gone from having no knowledge of Python and Blender at all to being able to create a working script. We faced significant problems initially, but gradually, we were able to make our script more and more advanced.

However, we still have much to learn within OpenBIM, as we spent as much time learning Python as OpenBIM. Now that we have a better understanding of Python, we believe that we have a better foundation to do even more with OpenBIM.
